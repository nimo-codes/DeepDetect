# DeepFake Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to our DeepFake Detection System! This project aims to combat the rising threat of deepfake technology by providing an effective and user-friendly solution. Our system utilizes the EfficientNet architecture combined with Mesonet for training a robust deepfake detection model.

## Features

- **Intuitive User Interface (UI):** The system boasts an easy-to-navigate UI, ensuring a seamless experience for users with varying technical backgrounds.
  
- **EfficientNet and Mesonet Integration:** The use of EfficientNet architecture, coupled with Mesonet, enhances the model's efficiency and accuracy, enabling precise identification of deepfake content.

- **Cybersecurity and Harassment Prevention:** Our deepfake detection system serves as a crucial defense against cyber threats, protecting individuals, including celebrities, from the misuse of manipulated media and potential reputational damage.

- **National Security and Legal Verification:** The project contributes to maintaining national security by preventing the dissemination of fabricated content. In legal contexts, it ensures the integrity of visual evidence, facilitating accurate legal proceedings and reinforcing accountability.
